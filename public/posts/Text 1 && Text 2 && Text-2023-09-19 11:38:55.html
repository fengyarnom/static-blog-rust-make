<p>When Microsoft bought task management app Wunderlist and mobile calendar Sunrise in 2015. It picked up two newcomers that were attracting considerable buzz in Silicon Valley. Microsoft’s own Office dominates the market for “productivity” software, but the start-ups represented a new wave of technology designed from the ground up for the smartphone world.</p>
<p>Both apps, however, were later scrapped, after Microsoft said it had used their best features in its own products. Their teams of engineers stayed on, making them two of the many “acqui-hires” that the biggest companies have used to feed their insatiable hunger for tech-talent.</p>
<p>To Microsoft’s critics, the fates of Wunderlist and Sunrise are examples of a remorseless drive by Big Tech to chew up any innovative companies that lie in their path. “They bought the seedlings and closed them down,” complained Paul Arnold, a partner at San Francisco-based Switch Ventures, putting paid to businesses that might one day turn into competitors. Microsoft declined to comment.</p>
<p>Like other start-up investors. Mr. Arnold’s own business often depends on selling start-ups to larger tech companies, though he admits to mixed feelings about the result: “I think these things are good for me, if I put my selfish hat on. But are they good for the American economy? I don't know.”</p>
<p>The US Federal Trade Commission says it wants to find the answer to that question. This week, it asked the five most valuable US tech companies for information about their many small acquisitions over the past decade. Although only a research project at this stage, the request has raised the prospect of regulators wading into early-stage tech markets that until now have been beyond their reach.</p>
<p>Given their combined market value of more than $5.5tn, rifling through such small deals—many of them much less prominent than Wunderlist and Sunrise—might seem beside the point. Between them, the five companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook) have spent an average of only $3.4bn a year on sub-$1bn acquisitions over the past five years—a drop in the ocean compared with their massive financial reserves, and the more than $130bn of venture capital that was invested in the US last year.</p>
<p>However, critics say that the big companies use such deals to buy their most threatening potential competitors before their businesses have a chance to gain momentum, in some cases as part of a “buy and kill” tactic to simply close them down.</p>
<p><strong>: rifling</strong></p>
<p>:: &quot;Rifling&quot; 是 &quot;rifle&quot; 的动名词形式，它通常用于描述枪支的一种内部结构或行为。具体来说，&quot;rifling&quot; 指的是枪管内的螺旋形槽纹或刻痕，这些槽纹帮助弹丸在射击时旋转，提高射击精度和稳定性。</p>
<p>在枪械领域，枪管内部的 &quot;rifling&quot; 起到了非常重要的作用，它有助于使弹丸旋转，从而保持其在飞行中的稳定性，提高了射击的准确性。</p>
<p>&quot;Rifling&quot; 这个词也可以引申用于其他领域，表示某物被刻上螺旋状的纹路或图案，或者表示某事被彻底搜寻或翻找，但通常情况下，它与枪械和弹道有关。</p>

<p>With the global population predicted to hit close to 10 billion by 2050, and forecasts that agricultural production in some regions will need to nearly double to keep pace, food security is increasingly making headlines. In the UK, it has become a big talking point recently too, for a rather particular reason: Brexit.</p>
<p>Brexit is seen by some as an opportunity to reverse a recent trend towards the UK importing food. The country produces only about 60 per cent of the food it eats, down from almost three-quarters in the late 1980s. A move back to self-sufficiency, the argument goes, would boost the farming industry, political sovereignty and even the nation’s health. Sounds great – but how feasible is this vision?</p>
<p>According to a report on UK food production from the University of Leeds, UK, 85 per cent of the country’s total land area is associated with meat and dairy production. That supplies 80 per cent of what is consumed, so even covering the whole country in livestock farms wouldn’t allow us to cover all our meat and dairy needs.</p>
<p>There are many caveats to those figures, but they are still grave. To become much more self-sufficient, the UK would need to drastically reduce its consumption of animal foods, and probably also farm more intensively – meaning fewer green fields, and more factory-style production.</p>
<p>But switching to a mainly plant-based diet wouldn’t help. There is a good reason why the UK is dominated by animal husbandry: most of its terrain doesn’t have the right soil or climate to grow crops on a commercial basis. Just 25 per cent of the country’s land is suitable for crop-growing, most of which is already occupied by arable fields. Even if we converted all the suitable land to fields of fruit and veg – which would involve taking out all the nature reserves and removing thousands of people from their homes – we would achieve only a 30 per cent boost in crop production.</p>
<p>Just 23 per cent of the fruit and vegetables consumed in the UK are currently home-grown, so even with the most extreme measures we could meet only 30 per cent of our fresh produce needs. That is before we look for the space to grow the grains, sugars, seeds and oils that provide us with the vast bulk of our current calorie intake.</p>
<p><strong>: 这句话如何理解：for a rather particular reason: Brexit.</strong></p>
<p>:: 这句话的意思是：出于一个相当特殊的原因，即英国脱欧。</p>
<p>在这句话中，&quot;for&quot; 表示出于某个原因或目的，而 &quot;a rather particular reason&quot; 意指一个相当特殊或独特的原因。最后的冒号 &quot;:&quot; 通常用来引出一个解释或说明，这里引出了具体的原因，即 &quot;Brexit&quot;，即英国脱欧。</p>
<p>所以，整句话的含义是，有一个相当特殊的原因，这个原因就是英国脱欧。可能后文会进一步解释或阐述为什么 Brexit 是一个特殊的原因。</p>
<p><strong>: 这句话如何理解：a rather</strong></p>
<p>:: &quot;a rather&quot; 是一个常见的英语短语，用来表示某事物或情况在程度上略微、相当或有点。它通常用于弱化表达的强度，使其显得更加温和或适度。在句子中，它可以用来修饰形容词、副词或名词，表示程度不是非常强烈，但也不是完全没有。这种短语通常用于正式或文学性的文体，以增强语气或准确表达。</p>
<p>例如：</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;It was a rather difficult exam.&quot;（这是一次相当难的考试。）</li>
<li>&quot;She's a rather talented artist.&quot;（她是一位相当有才华的艺术家。）</li>
<li>&quot;He seems rather upset today.&quot;（他今天似乎有点不高兴。）</li>
</ol>
<p>在你提供的句子中，&quot;a rather particular reason&quot; 意味着这个原因相对特殊，程度上不是非常特殊，但也不是普通或平凡的原因。</p>
<p><strong>: 这句话如何理解：the argument goes</strong></p>
<p>:: &quot;the argument goes&quot; 是一个常见的表达，用于引出某种观点、论点或看法。它通常用来引导一个说明或解释，以表明某人或某些人所持的观点是什么，或者用来介绍一种普遍的说法或理论。</p>
<p>这个短语的用法示例：</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;The argument goes that climate change is a result of human activity.&quot;（有一种观点认为气候变化是人类活动的结果。）</li>
<li>&quot;The argument goes that reducing taxes will stimulate economic growth.&quot;（有人认为降低税收会刺激经济增长。）</li>

<p>“Reskilling” is something that sounds like a buzzword but is actually a requirement if we plan to have a future where a lot of would-be workers do not get left behind. We know we are moving into a period where the jobs in demand will change rapidly, as will the requirements of the jobs that remain. Research by WEF detailed in the Harvard Business Review, finds that on average 42 per cent of the “core skills” within job roles will change by 2022. That is a very short timeline, so we can only imagine what the changes will be further in the future.</p>
<p>The question of who should pay for reskilling is a thorny one. For individual companies, the temptation is always to let go of workers whose skills are no longer in demand and replace them with those whose skills are. That does not always happen. AT&amp;T is often given as the gold standard of a company who decided to do a massive reskilling program rather than go with a fire-and-hire strategy, ultimately retraining 18,000 employers. Prepandemic, other companies including Amazon and Disney had also pledged to create their own plans. When the skills mismatch is in the broader economy though, the focus usually turns to government to handle. Efforts in Canada and elsewhere have been arguably languid at best, and have given us a situation where we frequently hear of employers begging for workers, even at times and in regions where unemployment is high.</p>
<p>With the pandemic, unemployment is very high indeed. In February, at 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively, unemployment rates in Canada and the United States were at generational lows and worker shortages were everywhere. As of May, those rates had spiked up to 13.3 per cent and 13.7 per cent, and although many worker shortages had disappeared, not all had done so. In the medical filed, to take an obvious example, the pandemic meant that there were still clear shortages of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not like you can take an unemployed waiter and train him to be a doctor in a few weeks, no matter who pays for it. But even if you cannot close that gap, maybe you can close others, and doing so would be to the benefit of all concerned. That seems to be the case in Sweden: when forced to furlough 90 per cent of their cabin staff, Scandinavian Airlines decided to start up a short retraining program that reskilled the laid-off workers to support hospital staff. The effort was a collective one and involved other companies as well as a Swedish university.</p>
<p>: 如何翻译这句话：Efforts in Canada and elsewhere have been arguably languid at best</p>
<p>:: 这句话的语法结构比较复杂，让我们逐步解释它：</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Efforts in Canada and elsewhere&quot; - 这部分指的是在加拿大和其他地方的努力。&quot;Efforts&quot; 是主语，表示人们所做的努力。</li>
<li>&quot;have been&quot; - 这是句子的谓语动词，使用了现在完成时，表示动作或状态从过去某一点一直延续到现在。在这里，它指的是努力的状态或趋势。</li>
<li>&quot;arguably&quot; - 这个词表示一种观点或看法，暗示有人可能会提出争议或不同的看法。在这句话中，它表明下文会对努力的程度提出质疑或不同看法。</li>
<li>&quot;languid&quot; - 这个词形容努力的性质，意味着努力的进展缓慢，不够有活力或热情。</li>
<li>&quot;at best&quot; - 这个短语表示在最好的情况下，即使是最积极的看法也不能改变努力的不足或缓慢。</li>
</ol>
<p>因此，整句话的意思是，人们在加拿大和其他地方所做的努力在最好的情况下也可以说是进展缓慢，甚至有人会质疑它们是否足够积极。</p>
