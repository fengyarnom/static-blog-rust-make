<p>We’re fairly good at judging people based on first impressions, thin slices of experience ranging from a glimpse of a photo to a five-minute interaction, and deliberation can be not only extraneous but intrusive. In one study of the ability she dubbed “thin slicing,” the late psychologist Nalini Ambady asked participants to watch silent 10-second video clips of professors and to rate the instructor’s overall effectiveness. Their ratings correlated strongly with students’ end-of-semester ratings. Another set of participants had to count backward from 1,000 by nines as they watched the clips, occupying their conscious working memory. Their ratings were just as accurate, demonstrating the intuitive nature of the social processing.</p>
<p>Critically, another group was asked to spend a minute writing down reasons for their judgment, before giving the rating. Accuracy dropped dramatically. Ambady suspected that</p>
<p>deliberation focused them on vivid but misleading cues, such as certain gestures or utterances, rather than letting the complex interplay of subtle signals form a holistic impression. She found similar interference when participants watched 15-second clips of pairs of people and judged whether they were strangers, friends, or dating partners.</p>
<p>Other research shows we’re better at detecting deception and sexual orientation from thin slices when we rely on intuition instead of reflection. “It’s as if you’re driving a stick shift,” says Judith Hall, a psychologist at Northeastern University, “and if you start thinking about it too much, you can’t remember what you’re doing. But if you go on automatic pilot, you’re fine. Much of our social life is like that.”</p>
<p>Thinking too much can also harm our ability to form preferences. College students’ ratings of strawberry jams and college courses aligned better with experts’ opinions when the students weren’t asked to analyze their rationale. And people made car-buying decisions that were both objectively better and more personally satisfying when asked to focus on their feelings rather than on details, but only if the decision was complex—when they had a lot of information to process.</p>
<p>Intuition’s special powers are unleashed only in certain circumstances. In one study, participants completed a battery of eight tasks, including four that tapped reflective thinking (discerning rules, comprehending vocabulary) and four that tapped intuition and creativity (generating new products or figures of speech). Then they rated the degree to which they had used intuition (“gut feelings,” “hunches,” “my heart”). Use of their gut hurt their performance on the first four tasks, as expected, and helped them on the rest. Sometimes the heart is smarter than the head.</p>

<p>When Microsoft bought task management app Wunderlist and mobile calendar Sunrise in 2015. It picked up two newcomers that were attracting considerable buzz in Silicon Valley. Microsoft’s own Office dominates the market for “productivity” software, but the start-ups represented a new wave of technology designed from the ground up for the smartphone world.</p>
<p>Both apps, however, were later scrapped, after Microsoft said it had used their best features in its own products. Their teams of engineers stayed on, making them two of the many “acqui-hires” that the biggest companies have used to feed their insatiable hunger for tech-talent.</p>
<p>To Microsoft’s critics, the fates of Wunderlist and Sunrise are examples of a remorseless drive by Big Tech to chew up any innovative companies that lie in their path. “They bought the seedlings and closed them down,” complained Paul Arnold, a partner at San Francisco-based Switch Ventures, putting paid to businesses that might one day turn into competitors. Microsoft declined to comment.</p>
<p>Like other start-up investors. Mr. Arnold’s own business often depends on selling start-ups to larger tech companies, though he admits to mixed feelings about the result: “I think these things are good for me, if I put my selfish hat on. But are they good for the American economy? I don't know.”</p>
<p>The US Federal Trade Commission says it wants to find the answer to that question. This week, it asked the five most valuable US tech companies for information about their many small acquisitions over the past decade. Although only a research project at this stage, the request has raised the prospect of regulators wading into early-stage tech markets that until now have been beyond their reach.</p>
<p>Given their combined market value of more than $5.5tn, rifling through such small deals—many of them much less prominent than Wunderlist and Sunrise—might seem beside the point. Between them, the five companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook) have spent an average of only $3.4bn a year on sub-$1bn acquisitions over the past five years—a drop in the ocean compared with their massive financial reserves, and the more than $130bn of venture capital that was invested in the US last year.</p>
<p>However, critics say that the big companies use such deals to buy their most threatening potential competitors before their businesses have a chance to gain momentum, in some cases as part of a “buy and kill” tactic to simply close them down.</p>
<p><strong>: rifling</strong></p>
<p>:: &quot;Rifling&quot; 是 &quot;rifle&quot; 的动名词形式，它通常用于描述枪支的一种内部结构或行为。具体来说，&quot;rifling&quot; 指的是枪管内的螺旋形槽纹或刻痕，这些槽纹帮助弹丸在射击时旋转，提高射击精度和稳定性。</p>
<p>在枪械领域，枪管内部的 &quot;rifling&quot; 起到了非常重要的作用，它有助于使弹丸旋转，从而保持其在飞行中的稳定性，提高了射击的准确性。</p>
<p>&quot;Rifling&quot; 这个词也可以引申用于其他领域，表示某物被刻上螺旋状的纹路或图案，或者表示某事被彻底搜寻或翻找，但通常情况下，它与枪械和弹道有关。</p>

<p>With the global population predicted to hit close to 10 billion by 2050, and forecasts that agricultural production in some regions will need to nearly double to keep pace, food security is increasingly making headlines. In the UK, it has become a big talking point recently too, for a rather particular reason: Brexit.</p>
<p>Brexit is seen by some as an opportunity to reverse a recent trend towards the UK importing food. The country produces only about 60 per cent of the food it eats, down from almost three-quarters in the late 1980s. A move back to self-sufficiency, the argument goes, would boost the farming industry, political sovereignty and even the nation’s health. Sounds great – but how feasible is this vision?</p>
<p>According to a report on UK food production from the University of Leeds, UK, 85 per cent of the country’s total land area is associated with meat and dairy production. That supplies 80 per cent of what is consumed, so even covering the whole country in livestock farms wouldn’t allow us to cover all our meat and dairy needs.</p>
<p>There are many caveats to those figures, but they are still grave. To become much more self-sufficient, the UK would need to drastically reduce its consumption of animal foods, and probably also farm more intensively – meaning fewer green fields, and more factory-style production.</p>
<p>But switching to a mainly plant-based diet wouldn’t help. There is a good reason why the UK is dominated by animal husbandry: most of its terrain doesn’t have the right soil or climate to grow crops on a commercial basis. Just 25 per cent of the country’s land is suitable for crop-growing, most of which is already occupied by arable fields. Even if we converted all the suitable land to fields of fruit and veg – which would involve taking out all the nature reserves and removing thousands of people from their homes – we would achieve only a 30 per cent boost in crop production.</p>
<p>Just 23 per cent of the fruit and vegetables consumed in the UK are currently home-grown, so even with the most extreme measures we could meet only 30 per cent of our fresh produce needs. That is before we look for the space to grow the grains, sugars, seeds and oils that provide us with the vast bulk of our current calorie intake.</p>
<p><strong>: 这句话如何理解：for a rather particular reason: Brexit.</strong></p>
<p>:: 这句话的意思是：出于一个相当特殊的原因，即英国脱欧。</p>
<p>在这句话中，&quot;for&quot; 表示出于某个原因或目的，而 &quot;a rather particular reason&quot; 意指一个相当特殊或独特的原因。最后的冒号 &quot;:&quot; 通常用来引出一个解释或说明，这里引出了具体的原因，即 &quot;Brexit&quot;，即英国脱欧。</p>
<p>所以，整句话的含义是，有一个相当特殊的原因，这个原因就是英国脱欧。可能后文会进一步解释或阐述为什么 Brexit 是一个特殊的原因。</p>
<p><strong>: 这句话如何理解：a rather</strong></p>
<p>:: &quot;a rather&quot; 是一个常见的英语短语，用来表示某事物或情况在程度上略微、相当或有点。它通常用于弱化表达的强度，使其显得更加温和或适度。在句子中，它可以用来修饰形容词、副词或名词，表示程度不是非常强烈，但也不是完全没有。这种短语通常用于正式或文学性的文体，以增强语气或准确表达。</p>

<li>&quot;He seems rather upset today.&quot;（他今天似乎有点不高兴。）</li>
</ol>
<p>在你提供的句子中，&quot;a rather particular reason&quot; 意味着这个原因相对特殊，程度上不是非常特殊，但也不是普通或平凡的原因。</p>
<p><strong>: 这句话如何理解：the argument goes</strong></p>
<p>:: &quot;the argument goes&quot; 是一个常见的表达，用于引出某种观点、论点或看法。它通常用来引导一个说明或解释，以表明某人或某些人所持的观点是什么，或者用来介绍一种普遍的说法或理论。</p>
<p>这个短语的用法示例：</p>

<h3>Text 1</h3>
<p>“Reskilling” is something that sounds like a buzzword but is actually a requirement if we plan to have a future where a lot of would-be workers do not get left behind. We know we are moving into a period where the jobs in demand will change rapidly, as will the requirements of the jobs that remain. Research by WEF detailed in the Harvard Business Review, finds that on average 42 per cent of the “core skills” within job roles will change by 2022. That is a very short timeline, so we can only imagine what the changes will be further in the future.</p>
<p>The question of who should pay for reskilling is a thorny one. For individual companies, the temptation is always to let go of workers whose skills are no longer in demand and replace them with those whose skills are. That does not always happen. AT&amp;T is often given as the gold standard of a company who decided to do a massive reskilling program rather than go with a fire-and-hire strategy, ultimately retraining 18,000 employers. Prepandemic, other companies including Amazon and Disney had also pledged to create their own plans. When the skills mismatch is in the broader economy though, the focus usually turns to government to handle. Efforts in Canada and elsewhere have been arguably languid at best, and have given us a situation where we frequently hear of employers begging for workers, even at times and in regions where unemployment is high.</p>
<p>With the pandemic, unemployment is very high indeed. In February, at 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively, unemployment rates in Canada and the United States were at generational lows and worker shortages were everywhere. As of May, those rates had spiked up to 13.3 per cent and 13.7 per cent, and although many worker shortages had disappeared, not all had done so. In the medical filed, to take an obvious example, the pandemic meant that there were still clear shortages of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not like you can take an unemployed waiter and train him to be a doctor in a few weeks, no matter who pays for it. But even if you cannot close that gap, maybe you can close others, and doing so would be to the benefit of all concerned. That seems to be the case in Sweden: when forced to furlough 90 per cent of their cabin staff, Scandinavian Airlines decided to start up a short retraining program that reskilled the laid-off workers to support hospital staff. The effort was a collective one and involved other companies as well as a Swedish university.</p>
<p>: 如何翻译这句话：Efforts in Canada and elsewhere have been arguably languid at best</p>
<p>:: 这句话的语法结构比较复杂，让我们逐步解释它：</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Efforts in Canada and elsewhere&quot; - 这部分指的是在加拿大和其他地方的努力。&quot;Efforts&quot; 是主语，表示人们所做的努力。</li>
<li>&quot;have been&quot; - 这是句子的谓语动词，使用了现在完成时，表示动作或状态从过去某一点一直延续到现在。在这里，它指的是努力的状态或趋势。</li>
<li>&quot;arguably&quot; - 这个词表示一种观点或看法，暗示有人可能会提出争议或不同的看法。在这句话中，它表明下文会对努力的程度提出质疑或不同看法。</li>
<li>&quot;languid&quot; - 这个词形容努力的性质，意味着努力的进展缓慢，不够有活力或热情。</li>
<li>&quot;at best&quot; - 这个短语表示在最好的情况下，即使是最积极的看法也不能改变努力的不足或缓慢。</li>
</ol>
<p>因此，整句话的意思是，人们在加拿大和其他地方所做的努力在最好的情况下也可以说是进展缓慢，甚至有人会质疑它们是否足够积极。</p>

<p>目前它只是一个堪堪能用的状态，我甚至还没想好它的名字，现在只是使用 <code>static-blog-rust-make</code> 作为项目名字，我并没有想出一个正式的名字。我目前开源在<a href="https://github.com/fengyarnom/static-blog-rust-make">Github</a> 上，由于时间实在是不够用，我在有限的时间内已经做到了极限，优化代码和新功能的添加只能在日后完成了，但是，我仍然十分满意于这个项目！</p>
<p>虽然如此，这个生成器确实已经可以正常使用。我用它来重新生成了一个这个网站，并将之前为 Hexo 写的主题应用其中。目前的版本是 <em><strong>v0.03</strong></em> 。项目仅仅是一个粗劣地模仿 Hexo 的产物，并没有融入很多我的思考，很多核心功能也只是调用别人写好的包，但是这次的代码仍然给我很多地启示，我发觉我开始接触到了很多软件工程的内容，同时对一个项目的整体规划有了一些了解。总之，这一次的项目开发还是很有意思的，之后的一段时间会着手于新的开发文档，并希望能在书写开发文档的过程中，思考更多新的功能。</p>
<p>最后，这是一个非常不完美的项目，里面的代码混乱不堪，复杂的逻辑结构几乎把我压倒。在多次重构和清理冗杂代码后，确实完成了我一开始定下的所有功能需求，但是这样的代码总归让人看了倒胃口，但也只能在之后的日子里慢慢修改完善啦，至少它没有夭折在漫长的开发期中。我确实是以最快的速度开发的，为的就是减少枯燥，目前看来确实如此，我在耐心消耗殆尽前完成了这个项目。</p>

<h2>购买</h2>
<p>自从接触 Linux 之后渴望得到一个树莓派了，奈何因为疫情导致了全球的芯片供应紧张，树莓派的价格水涨船高，价格已经远远超过了它的价值，更重要的是超过了我的预算，即使是二手的价格也非常不值当。总之，出于囊中羞涩的考虑，我最终选择了这块国产的派 —— <strong>OrangePi Zero3.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/27/uq5Lpt4VhGs3eTZ.png" alt="2023-08-17_12-27.png" /></p>
<p>我购买的是内存为 1.5G 的版本价格为一百出头，刚拿到快递的时候我就疑惑了， 为何如此之小！开箱后更是震惊，它甚至没有我的巴掌大呢！虽然但是，这还是很精致的，而且对于这样的设备而言，小其实是更好的，更方便搭载在其他的设备上。</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/27/ZeyCJqUun7NYE2I.jpg" alt="photo_6264513425795298480_y.jpg" /></p>
<p>除开这块板子，我还另外买了：</p>
<ul>
<li>亚克力的外壳</li>
<li>风扇+散热片</li>
<li>USB to TTL 用于串口调试</li>
<li>64G 闪迪 tf 卡</li>
</ul>
<p>关于系统镜像方面，我还是选择了熟悉的 debian 发行版，毕竟我的 vps 用的也是这个，这块单板计算机我是拿来内网穿透的 <a href="http://www.orangepi.cn/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/service-and-support/Orange-Pi-Zero-3.html">官方镜像</a></p>

<h2>系统配置</h2>
<p>在向 tf 卡刷完系统后，就可以通过串口进行连接了。</p>
<h3>自动连接热点 WiFi</h3>
<p>使用串口多少是不方便的，所以先来配置一下网络，让其他机器可以通过 ssh 访问这块板子。</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>使用<code>nmcli dev wifi</code>查看当前扫描到的 wifi 列表。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>使用 <code>nmcli</code> 连接到热点并输入密码：</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo nmcli dev wifi connect YourHotspotName password YourPassword
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>将连接的配置设置为自动连接：</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo nmcli connection modify &quot;YourHotspotName&quot; connection.autoconnect yes
</code></pre>
<p>将 <code>YourHotspotName</code> 替换为你的热点名称，<code>YourPassword</code> 替换为密码。</p>
<p>完成后通过 <code>ip addr </code> 即可看到 ip 地址，然后就可以通过 ssh 正常访问板子了</p>
<h3>添加一个新用户</h3>
<pre><code>useradd -m -G additional_groups -s login_shell username
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">passwd username
</code></pre>
<p>然后去修改<code> /etc/sudoers</code> 文件</p>
<h2>FRP 内网穿透</h2>
<p>在这个 <a href="https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases">releases</a> 页面中，找到对应架构的压缩包，可以使用 <code>uname -a </code> 查看到。</p>
<ul>
<li>我的 VPS 是 X86_64 那么就选择 <a href="https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases/download/v0.51.3/frp_0.51.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz">amd64.tar.gz</a> 的包</li>
<li>香橙派是 arm 架构，那么就选择 <a href="https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases/download/v0.51.3/frp_0.51.3_linux_arm64.tar.gz">arm64.tar.gz </a>的包</li>
</ul>
<p>通过 <code>wget</code> 下载</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wget https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases/download/v0.51.3/frp_0.51.3_linux_arm64.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>通过 <code>tar</code> 解压</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">tar xvf frp_0.51.3_linux_arm64.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>frpc</strong>: 这是 FRP 客户端的可执行文件。FRP 客户端用于连接到 FRP 服务器并将内部网络服务暴露给外部访问。</li>
<li><strong>frps</strong>: 这是 FRP 服务器的可执行文件。FRP 服务器用于接收来自客户端的连接，并将这些连接转发到内部的网络服务。</li>
<li><strong>frpc.ini</strong>: 这是 FRP 客户端的配置文件，用于指定客户端的连接设置、代理规则等。</li>
<li><strong>frps.ini</strong>: 这是 FRP 服务器的配置文件，用于指定服务器的监听端口、代理规则等。</li>
<li><strong>frpc_full.ini</strong>: 这是 FRP 客户端的完整配置文件，可能包含更多详细的设置。</li>
<li><strong>frps_full.ini</strong>: 这是 FRP 服务器的完整配置文件，可能包含更多详细的设置。</li>
</ul>
<h3>服务器配置</h3>
<p>下载完对应架构的文件后，即可开始配置，只需要关心 <code>frps</code> 和 <code>frps.ini</code> 文件即可，前者是FRP 服务器的可执行文件，后者是这是 FRP 服务器的配置文件。</p>
<p>打开 <code>frps.ini</code>进行配置，配置文件的内容如下：</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">[common]
bind_port = 7000
token = 1234567890
</code></pre>
<p>客户端和服务器的配置文件中都需要设置相同的 Token 才能正确进行连接和通信。</p>
<p>为了保障安全性，你应该选择一个强密码的 Token，并确保不会轻易泄露给他人。如果你怀疑 Token 可能已经暴露，应当立即生成一个新的 Token 并更新配置文件。</p>
<p>完成后，运行 <code>./frpc -c ./frpc.ini</code></p>
<p>若无问题，则说明配置成功。</p>
<p>接下来，配置一下 systemd 服务，让上面这条运行命令能开机自动启动，这非常实用：</p>
<p>但是在此之前，我们需要先将 <code>frps</code> 和 <code>frps.ini</code> 文件放到合适的地方：</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp frps /usr/local/bin/
sudo mkdir /usr/local/etc/frp
sudo cp frps.ini /usr/local/etc/frp/
</code></pre>
<p>首先，创建一个名为<code>frps.service</code>的文件，该文件将存储有关你的自启动服务的信息。通常，这些文件存放在<code>/etc/systemd/system/</code>目录下。</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/frps.service
</code></pre>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=frps
After=network.target
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=30
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin/
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/frps -c /usr/local/etc/frp/frps.ini
Restart=on-failure
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>
<p>保存后，执行：</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable frps
sudo systemctl start frps
sudo systemctl status frps
</code></pre>
<p>若无问题，则可进入客户端的配置。</p>
<p>下面是一些常用的命令：</p>
<ul>
<li>启动服务：<code>sudo systemctl start frps</code></li>
<li>停止服务：<code>sudo systemctl stop frps</code></li>
<li>重启服务：<code>sudo systemctl restart frps</code></li>
<li>查看服务状态：<code>sudo systemctl status frps</code></li>
<li>关闭自启动：<code>sudo systemctl disable frps</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>客户端配置</h3>
<p>下载完对应架构的文件后，即可开始配置，只需要关心 <code>frpc</code> 和 <code>frpc.ini</code> 文件即可，前者是FRP 客户端的可执行文件，后者是这是 FRP 客户端的配置文件。</p>
<p><strong>假设：</strong></p>
<p><strong>服务器的ip地址是 1.1.1.1, 服务端frp正在监听的端口是7000, token是1234567890</strong></p>
<p><strong>客户端目前正在运行一个项目叫 bitwarden ,它正在本地 0.0.0.0 地址上监听 1111 端口</strong></p>
<p>打开 <code>frpc.ini</code>进行配置，配置文件的内容如下：</p>
<pre><code>[common]
server_addr = 1.1.1.1
server_port = 7000
token = 1234567890

[bitwarden]
type = tcp
local_ip = 0.0.0.0
local_port = 1111
remote_port = 8111
</code></pre>
<p>值得注意的是，配置文件中的 [bitwarden] 可以替换成任何想要的名字</p>
<p>为了方便，我们同样设置 systemd 服务</p>
<p>但是在此之前，我们需要先将 <code>frpc</code> 和 <code>frpc.ini</code> 文件放到合适的地方：</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp frpc /usr/local/bin/
sudo mkdir /usr/local/etc/frp
sudo cp frpc.ini /usr/local/etc/frp/
</code></pre>
<p>首先，创建一个名为<code>frpc.service</code>的文件，该文件将存储有关你的自启动服务的信息。通常，这些文件存放在<code>/etc/systemd/system/</code>目录下。</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/frpc.service
</code></pre>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=frpc
After=network.target
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=30
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin/
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/frpc -c /usr/local/etc/frp/frpc.ini
Restart=on-failure
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>
<p>保存后，执行：</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable frpc
sudo systemctl start frpc
sudo systemctl status frpc
</code></pre>
<p>若无问题的话，则说明没有问题！</p>
<h3>原理</h3>
<p>Frp（Fast Reverse Proxy）是一个用于内网穿透的工具，它允许你在公网上访问位于内网的计算机服务。它的原理是通过在公网服务器上部署 frps（Frp 服务器端）和在内网机器上部署 frpc（Frp 客户端），通过公网服务器作为中转，将外部请求转发到内网机器上。</p>
<ul>
<li>在公网服务器上部署 frps：公网服务器上运行的 frps 监听一个指定的端口，等待来自 frpc 的连接。</li>
<li>在内网机器上部署 frpc：内网机器上的 frpc 将建立到 frps 的连接，并注册自己的服务信息。frpc 和 frps 之间建立的连接可以被用于穿透数据。</li>
<li>数据传输：当公网客户端请求连接到公网服务器的指定端口时，frps 会将这个请求转发给已经连接的 frpc 客户端，然后 frpc 客户端再将请求转发到内网机器的指定服务上。</li>
</ul>
<p>在我上面的配置中，其转换的意思就是：</p>
<p>frps 监听在公网服务器的 7000 端口，frpc 连接到公网服务器的 7000 端口，并注册自己的服务信息。frpc 客户端配置了一个类型为 TCP 的服务，将本地的 bitwarden 服务映射到公网服务器的 8111 端口上。</p>
<p>若是请求 https://1.1.1.1:8111 那么这个请求就转发给客户端的 http://0.0.0.0:1111</p>
<h3>Nginx 配置</h3>
<p>我在服务器中是使用 Nginx 来进行反向代理的，若你的服务器不是，则可以跳过此内容。<strong>若你完全不了解 nginx 建议先去学习了之后再回来进行配置，因为此处我写得很简略，可能会对你产生误导。</strong></p>
<p>我的 Nginx 代理了80端口，所有的请求都是从此处进入上文提到，需要从 8111 端口进入才能访问内网，所以我需要对 nginx 添加一些配置：</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/27/RrNxIVbkSTgGQOy.png" alt="2023-08-17_15-48.png" /></p>
<p>这样，当请求 bitwarden 路径时，将会反向代理到 8111 端口</p>
<p>当然，通过 nginx 也可以配置子域名来访问，首先将三级域名 bitwarden.yarnom.top 通过 CNAME 指向当前的服务器地址</p>
<p>然后，nginx 设置一个新的 server ，server_name 就是这个三级域名：</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/27/DjX7LebSQftPovT.png" alt="2023-08-17_15-26.png" /></p>
<h2>搭建 <strong><a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden">Vaultwarden</a></strong></h2>
<p>由于官方的 Bitwarden 服务对于我的小机子来说过于庞大了，所以选择了社区用 Rust 编写 Vaultwarden 项目</p>
<p>它可以用 docker 搭建，那就是几条命令就能安装完毕：</p>
<pre><code>Pull the docker image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage:

docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run -d --name vaultwarden -v /vw-data/:/data/ --restart unless-stopped -p 80:80 vaultwarden/server:latest
</code></pre>
<p>完成！</p>
<h3>搭建 <a href="https://github.com/usememos/memos">Memos</a></h3>
<p>docker 搭建</p>
<pre><code>docker run -d --name memos -p 5230:5230 -v ~/.memos/:/var/opt/memos ghcr.io/usememos/memos:latest
</code></pre>
<p>自行修改参数即可。</p>
<p>完成！</p>

<p>虽说是千篇一律，但最近也是有好好用功的。最近在捣鼓一个新的项目：用 Rust 语言完成静态博客生成器。我目前使用的 Hexo 就是这样的工具，它将markdown文件转换为html文件，再对 tags 和 categories 等内容进行整理。这是之前未曾接触过的代码经历。</p>
<p>事实上，一开始为真的无从下手，于是我开始询问 ChatGPT，这真是一个很棒的人工智能，它认真地回答了我很多的问题，给予了我很多实际地代码。我用了一天时间了解了 rust 的语法，囫囵吞枣地学习显然不足以支撑我完成这个项目，但是有了 ChatGPT 的帮助，事情真的变得容易了很多，之后完成了这个项目，我会写一篇更详细的文章来介绍这一过程。</p>
